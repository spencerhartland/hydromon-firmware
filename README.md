Hydromon, short for hydration monitor, is a Cyberpunk 2077 inspired smart water bottle. This repository contains the code for the Hydromon's firmware. The firmware is written in MicroPython, and is designed to run on an ESP32-based board. Using the `aioble` library, the device communicates with the iOS companion app via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE).
